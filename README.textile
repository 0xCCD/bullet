h3. Usage

h4. Eager Loading, protect N+1 query

# add configuration to environment (optional)
<code>
Bullet::Association.logger = true # if logger is true (default value), the N+1 query hints will be appended to log/bullet.log. Otherwise, no hint to log/bullet.log.
Bullet::Association.alert = true # If alert is true (default value), alert box will popup if there is N+1 query when browsing web page. Otherwise, no alert box.
</code>

# browse the webpage, if there are N+1 queries, alert box and log will generate according to configurations.

# example of <code>log/bullet.log</code>
<code>2009-08-16 13:18:53[INFO] PATH_INFO: /posts    model: Post => assocations: comments</code>
It represents that in page '/posts', there is a N+1 query from Post to comments. It means you may have a logic code in controller <code>@posts = Post.find(:all)</code> should be changed to <code>@posts = Post.find(:all, :include => :comments)</code>
